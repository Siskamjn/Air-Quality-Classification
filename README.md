Air Quality Classification Program
This repository contains an Air Quality Classification Program developed using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method with GridSearch CV hyperparameter optimization. The project is designed to classify air quality levels based on given input data, improving accuracy through optimized model parameters.

üöÄ Features
Classification Model Optimization: Utilizes GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the SVM model.
Performance Evaluation: Displays confusion matrix and model metrics (precision, recall, f1-score).
User Input Handling: Allows users to input category numbers and receive relevant classification data.
Excel-Based System Display: Processes classification results and organizes them into an Excel spreadsheet.
Python-Based System Display: Outputs classification results in a structured text format.
